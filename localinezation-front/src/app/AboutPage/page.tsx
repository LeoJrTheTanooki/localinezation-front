                        LocaLINEzation was made to help break the langauge barrier between foreign fans of any given media. While it doesn&rsquo;t  provide full translations, it helps to make cracks into a given media&rsquo;s language barrier in hopes of eventually leading to a full translation and/or localization of said media. Individuals are also able to participate in the translation while improving their own skillsets in the process, and potentially getting a vital role in a full translation.
